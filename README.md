# DelekHomes-Project
### Welcome to my SDET project!
This repository showcases my experience in software quality assurance, highlighting test cases, API testing collections and automations that demonstrate my skills in both manual and automated testing.

### About Me
Iâ€™m Henrique Tonel, a 19-year-old Software Engineering student with 3 years of experience in QA, passionate about constant learning and evolving my skills. My journey in QA started out of curiosity and dedication to delivering reliable software, and since then, Iâ€™ve focused on mastering testing processes and tools.

Iâ€™ve worked extensively on testing applications for web and mobile platforms, performing functional, integration, and API tests to ensure seamless user experiences. My expertise includes automation testing using Playwright, API testing with Postman, and writing detailed test cases to manage defects efficiently. I actively participate in Agile development cycles to ensure quality in every release.

I thrive in collaborative environments, working with both onshore and offshore teams, and I bring a proactive mindset to problem-solving, quality improvement, and continuous learning. Tools like JIRA, Zephyr, and Qase.io are part of my daily workflow, helping me maintain high standards even in fast-paced release cycles.
